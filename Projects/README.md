# C Projects

This folder contains various projects built while learning the C programming language. Each project here is designed to apply and reinforce different concepts of C programming, from basic to advanced topics.

## 📂 Project List

1. [**Project 1**](./Project%201/)
   - **Name of Project**: Number Guessing Game
   - **Description**: We will write a program that generates a random number and asks the player to guess 
                      it. If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower 
                      number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “Higher 
                      number please”. When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of 
                      guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
   - **Key Concepts**: Variables, Random Number Generation, Conditional Statements, Loops, User Input, Input Validation, Functions (if used), Control Flow
   - **Status**: Complete
   - **Level**: Basic
## 🔨 How to Run the Projects

To run any project, navigate to the project directory and compile the C file(s) with a C compiler:

```bash
gcc project_name.c -o project_name
./project_name
