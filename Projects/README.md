# C Projects

This folder contains various projects built while learning the C programming language. Each project here is designed to apply and reinforce different concepts of C programming, from basic to advanced topics.

## üìÇ Project List

1. [**Project 1**](./Project%201/)
   - **Name of Project**: Number Guessing Game
   - **Description**: We will write a program that generates a random number and asks the player to guess 
                      it. If the player‚Äôs guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays ‚ÄúLower 
                      number please‚Äù. Similarly, if the user‚Äôs guess is too low, the program prints ‚ÄúHigher 
                      number please‚Äù. When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of 
                      guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
   - **Key Concepts**: Variables, Random Number Generation, Conditional Statements, Loops, User Input, Input Validation, Functions (if used), Control Flow
   - **Status**: Complete
   - **Level**: Basic

2. [**Project 2**](./Project%202/)
   - **Name of Project**: Star Pattern Printing
   - **Description**: The Program takes input from the user as number of rows and Accordingly prints the following star patterns
                      which includes Right Angle Triangle(Left Aligned), Right Angle Triangle(Right Aligned), Inverted Right Angle Triangle(Left Aligned), Inverted Right Angle Triangle(Right Aligned), Pyramid, Inverted Pyramid, Diamond
   - **key Concepts**: Nested Loops, User input, Input Validation
   - **Status**: Complete
   - **Level**: Basic
## üî® How to Run the Projects

To run any project, navigate to the project directory and compile the C file(s) with a C compiler:

```bash
gcc project_name.c -o project_name
./project_name
