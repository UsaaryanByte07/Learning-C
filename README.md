## About the Journey
I started learning C programming to strengthen my foundational knowledge of programming languages and understand low-level programming. This journey will cover various aspects of C, including basics, data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming.

## Projects and Exercises
- **Basics**: Simple programs covering basic syntax, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting and searching algorithms implemented in C.

## Learning Goals
- Master the syntax and semantics of C programming.
- Understand memory management and pointers.
- Implement data structures and algorithms.
- Write efficient and clean code in C.
